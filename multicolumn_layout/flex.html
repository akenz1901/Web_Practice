            <h2>Micro-Computer Room</h2>
            <p>A microcomputer is a complete computer on a small scale, designed for 
                use by one person at a time. An antiquated term, a microcomputer is now primarily 
                called a personal computer (PC), or a device based on a single-chip microprocessor. 
                Common microcomputers include laptops and desktops. Beyond standard PCs, microcomputers 
                also include some calculators, mobile phones, notebooks, workstations and embedded systems.
            </p>
            <p>Smaller than a mainframe or minicomputer, a microcomputer uses a single integrated semiconductor chip 
                for its central processing unit (CPU). They also contain memory in the form of read-only memory (ROM) 
                and random access memory (RAM), input/output (I/O) ports, and a bus or system of 
                interconnecting wires, all housed in a single unit usually referred to as a motherboard.
            </p>
            <p>The term microcomputer dates back to the 1970s. The advent of the Intel 4004 microprocessor 
                in 1971, and later the Intel 8008 and Intel 8080 microprocessor in 1972 and 1974 respectively, 
                paved the path to the creation of the microcomputer.
                The first microcomputer was the Micral, released in 1973 by Réalisation d'Études Électroniques (R2E). 
                Based on the Intel 8008, it was the first non-kit computer based on a microprocessor. 
                In 1974, the Intel 8008-based MCM/70 microcomputer was released by Micro Computer Machines Inc. 
                (later known as MCM Computers).

                Though released after the Micral and MCM/70, the Altair 8800 is often considered the first successful
                 commercial microcomputer. Released in 1974, it was designed by Micro Instrumentation Telemetry Systems
                  (MITS) and was based on the Intel 8080 microprocessor. It retailed for around $400 in kit form, 
                  $600 assembled ($2,045 and $3,067 in 2018 dollars, respectively).
